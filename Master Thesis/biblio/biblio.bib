  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new shadow mapping technique that improves upon the quality of perspective and uniform shadow maps. Our technique uses a perspective transform specified in light space which allows treating all lights as directional lights and does not change the direction of the light sources. This gives all the benefits of the perspective mapping but avoids the problems inherent in perspective shadow mapping like singularities in post-perspective space, missed shadow casters etc. Furthermore, we show that both uniform and perspective shadow maps distribute the perspective aliasing error that occurs in shadow mapping unequally over the available depth range. We therefore propose a transform that equalizes this error and gives equally pleasing results for near and far viewing distances. Our method is simple to implement, requires no scene analysis and is therefore as fast as uniform shadow mapping.},

  abstract = {Shadow maps are commonly used in real-time rendering, but they cannot be filtered linearly like standard color, resulting in severe aliasing. Variance shadow maps resolve this problem by representing the depth distribution using moments, which can be linearly filtered. However, variance shadow maps suffer from "light bleeding" artifacts and require high-precision texture filtering hardware.We introduce layered variance shadow maps, which provide simultaneous solutions to both of these limitations. By partitioning the shadow map depth range into multiple layers, we eliminate all light bleeding between different layers. Using more layers increases the quality of the shadows at the expense of additional storage. Because each of these layers covers a reduced depth range, they can be stored in lower precision than would be required with typical variance shadow maps, enabling their use on a much wider range of graphics hardware. We also describe an iterative optimization algorithm to automatically position layers so as to maximize the utility of each.Our algorithm is easy to implement on current graphics hardware and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the problem of shadow map filtering.},
