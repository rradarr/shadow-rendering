\section{Implemented shadow rendering techniques}
Below, all the shadow rendering techniques that have been implemented during work on this thesis are described, along with explanations of their algorithms.

\subsection{Planar shadows implementation}
\label{section:planar_shadows_impl}

Planar shadows, as described in section \ref{section:planar_shadows}, are a very simple technique to achieve hard shadows, introduced by Blinn \cite{bib:article:blinn_shadows}. The idea for the algorithm stems from the geometric understanding of how a shadow is formed. The shape of a shadow is basically the shadow caster projected onto the surface of a shadow receiver along rays from a light source, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:projection_shadow}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./graf/projection_shadow.pdf}
	\caption{Vertices of a shadow caster projected onto \(y=0\) plane create a planar shadow. Dashed lines visualize the similar triangles.}
	\label{fig:projection_shadow}
\end{figure}

Using this geometric understanding and similar triangles, marked in Fig. \ref{fig:projection_shadow} in dashed lines, the following equations and a projection matrix can be derived. Assuming \(l\) to be the position of a light source, \(v\) to be the position of a vertex of the shadow caster and \(p\) the position of the projected shadow vertex, a projection onto the \(y=0\) plane is described by:

\begin{align}
	\frac{p_x - l_x}{v_x - l_x} = \frac{l_y}{l_y - v_y} \Longleftrightarrow p_x = \frac{l_yv_x - l_xv_y}{l_y - v_y}
\end{align}

The \(z\) component is derived in analogous way:

\begin{align}
	\frac{p_z - l_z}{v_z - l_z} = \frac{l_y}{l_y - v_y} \Longleftrightarrow p_z = \frac{l_yv_z - l_zv_y}{l_y - v_y}
\end{align}

The \(y\) component will be \(y=0\) since the projection happens onto the \(xz\) plane. From that the projection matrix can be constructed:

\begin{align}
	\mathbf{M} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		l_y & -l_x & 0 & 0\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		0 & -l_z & l_y & 0\\
		0 & -1 & 0 & l_y
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

The \(l_y - v_y\) factor in the denominator is obtained by utilizing the property of homogenous coordinates, where all components of a vector \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}x & y & z & w\end{bmatrix}^T\) get divided by the \(w\) component, which gives \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}x/w & y/w & z/w & 1\end{bmatrix}^T\).

This matrix can be generalized to project points onto any plane, but this was not implemented.

In the implementation the matrix is created in the vertex shader based on the position of the light source. The vertices of the caster, after being transformed into world space, are multiplied by it, projecting them onto the \(y=0\) plane. Then they are transformed with the view and perspective projection matrices as usual. The resulting mesh is rendered in black, with a pixel shader that just returns the black color. Special care should be taken when rendering the shadow mesh, since it perfectly overlaps the ground plane at \(y=0\). To avoid z-fighting, which is shown in Fig \ref{fig:projection_shadow_beyond}, this mesh needs to be rendered after the receiver and before the caster, with z depth testing turned off in the rendering pipeline, or, as is the case in the implementation, a negative depth offset needs to be added to the mesh to bring it above the ground plane.

	\caption{The shadow caster projected through a light source, creating an anti-shadow.}
	\label{fig:projection_anti_shadow}
\end{figure}

Multiple issues arise with this technique. The receiver must be a flat plane, objects cannot shadow themselves, casters and receivers need separate treatment. Additionally, care needs to be taken to only render the shadow meshes on top of the geometry of a receiver. Since the shadow is a separate mesh, it could be cast beyond the actual surface of the receiver, creating an impossible shadow in the air. This is illustrated in Fig \ref{fig:projection_shadow_fighting} There is another possibility here for an impossible shadow. If the light source is between the caster and receiver, an anti-shadow will be cast as shown in Fig \ref{fig:projection_anti_shadow}. This creates another special case that needs to be checked for by the application. Soft shadows are also difficult and costly to achieve, created by projecting the caster geometry multiple times using different discrete locations sampled over the area of the light source. The shadow meshes can then be blended, producing a darker color where more shadows are present. This gives very accurate results with a high number of samples, but is not a viable option for real-time rendering. All these problems make this technique virtually unused in modern rendering engines.

% TODO: add some notes on performance.

\subsection{Implementation of basic shadow mapping}
\label{section:basic_mapping_impl}
As mentioned in chapter \ref{section:basic_mapping}, shadow mapping for a single light source is performed using two render passes. The first one generates the shadow map itself, the second and final pass renders the scene with shadows determined using the shadow map. The shadow map is a z-buffer, which means that, for each texel, it stores the values of the z coordinate of the scene surface point being rendered. These coordinates are stored after transforming the vertices of the scene into the NDC space, or normalized device coordinate space, of a given light source. This transformation is achieved in the vertex shader, by using the regular world, view, projection (WVP) transformation matrices, with the distinction that the view and projection matrices are not of the scene observer but of the light source. In truth, multiplying the vertex positions by the WVP matrix will result in clip space homogenous coordinates, which then will be transformed automatically by the pipeline into NDC during the perspective division, when the homogenous coordinates are divided by their \(w\) component. The stored depth values will then be in the \(0-1\) range, usually \(0\) being at the near clipping plane and \(1\) at the far clipping plane. This z-buffer can then be used as a texture shader resource in a pixel shader to render the final scene. To read the depth values from the shadow map, the NDC coordinates of each surface point need to be calculated again. The \(x\) any \(y\) components will then be used to access a texel in the shadow map, the \(z\) component will be compared with the contents of the shadow map. Do note that the actual Euclidean distance between the shaded point and the light source is not used, as these values would be in different coordinate spaces. When the shadow map value is accessed, it is compared with the \(z\) value of the point that is currently being shaded. If the shadow map value is greater, then the point being shaded is farther away from the light source than some other surface seen at this point from the point of view of the light. This means that it is not illuminated and is in shadow. Otherwise, the point is lit by the light source. The process is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:shadow_map_basic}. Fig. \ref{fig:shadow_map_screens} shows a rendered view of a scene with shadow mapping and the shadow map itself.

	\caption{The light source \(l\) has stored the depth value \(z_l\) in its shadow map. When rendering the scene from the viewpoint of the observer \(v\), the stored depth is compared to the depth \(z_v\). This value will be larger than the one in the shadow map, so the point will be in shadow.}

    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{An example scene rendered with a shadow map, which is shown in black and white.}
    \label{fig:shadow_map_screens}
\end{figure}

To implement this technique a resource is needed that will be used both as an additional depth buffer and a texture. This can be easily achieved in an application programming interface (API) like DirectX 12 by creating one resource and two resource views, one being a Depth Stencil View (DSV) and another a Shader resource view (SRV). Once the rendering of the shadow map is finished using the DSV, the resource can be transitioned in preparation to be used as an SRV during rendering the main view using a resource barrier. Caution needs to be taken to transition the resource back to a DSV-compatible state before rendering the shadow map of the next frame. In this case, a resource barrier will also ensure that all write operations have finished before continuing with rendering, meaning that the rendering of the shadow map will be complete before it is used in the final pass. The shaders responsible for rendering the main scene view will evidently need access to the texture resource containing the shadow map, but also it will need to access the view and projection matrices of the light view pass. This is to calculate the corresponding NDC coordinates of the point being shaded in the shadow map. It is optimal to calculate light clip space coordinates in the vertex shader and let the pipeline interpolate them across the triangle for each fragment. Since the perspective division will not happen automatically here, it is needed to divide the coordinates by the \(w\) component in the pixel shader to obtain correct NDC values. Since the shadow map is sampled as a texture, the \(xy\) coordinates with range \([-1:1]\) need to be converted into \(uv\) texture coordinates with range \([0:1]\). Additionally, the \(y\) component needs to be flipped to address the texture correctly. This can be performed as a simple transformation in the pixel shader as \(\begin{bmatrix}x & y\end{bmatrix}^T /  \begin{bmatrix}2 & -2\end{bmatrix}^T + \begin{bmatrix}0.5 & 0.5\end{bmatrix}^T\) or incorporated into the MVP matrix of the light view. This can be achieved by multiplying the MVP matrix for the light source by the offset matrix as shown in equation \ref{eq:offset_matrix_shadow_mapping}.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:offset_matrix_shadow_mapping}
	\mathbf{L_{offset}} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0.5\\
		0 & -0.5 & 0 & 0.5\\
		0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
	\cdot \mathbf{MVP}
\end{align}

When sampling the shadow map as a texture, it is important to do so with a sampler that does not perform any filtering on the texture. Typically, texture filtering helps avoid different kinds of aliasing. Regular color textures however can be filtered and interpolated as they only store color data. The shadow map, which stores depth values, cannot be filtered in the same way as the produced values would be senseless in this process. They would create non-existing apparent surfaces especially noticeable between sharp depth changes, for example between a close object and the far clipping plane.

This observation brings forth one of the issues with shadow mapping: they cannot be filtered to avoid aliasing. One could also attempt to blur a shadow map to achieve soft shadows, but this is not a viable option for the same reason. Because of this basic shadow mapping can only be used to create hard shadows that suffer from aliasing issues, creating shadows that can appear blocky when up close, as in Fig. \ref{fig:shadow_mapping_blocky}. Aliasing can be mitigated by rendering the shadow map into a higher resolution target, but only to a degree. Special techniques allowing for smoothing and filtering shadows generated with shadow mapping will be presented in the following sections.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./graf/shadow_mapping_blocky.png}
	\caption{Aliased shadow appearance due to no filtering and low resolution of the shadow map.}
	\label{fig:shadow_mapping_blocky}
\end{figure}

When rendering the shadow map an appropriate projection matrix has to be constructed. For a far away directional light, such as a sun light, an orthographic projection should be used. When rendering a spotlight a perspective projection can be used. Point lights can also use a single shadow map with a perspective projection matrix, but only in situations when the light source is positioned outside the scene, or at least is not surrounded by shadow casters. In the opposite case, the most common technique is to use cubemaps and improved derivative techniques as described by Liang Wan \cite{bib:article:wan_cubemaps}. A cubemap consists of six shadow map renders, each covering a face of a cube constructed around the light source. This way an omnidirectional shadow map is created.

When creating a projection matrix as well as the view matrix for a shadow map, care has to be taken to capture all relevant shadow casters. This is especially true for large scale scenes and directional lights, as rendering the entirety of a scene into the shadow map would most of the time be unnecessary and suboptimal. Most of the rendered map would not be used in a given frame, and the distribution of shadow map resolution would be poor. It would be enough for the light view to tightly encompass the view frustum of the observer to obtain correct results. This is called fitting and will be presented in the following sections. This idea can be taken further as shown by Ji\v{r}\'{\i} Bittner \cite{bib:proc:bittner_caster_culling} to allow for an approximate FPS gain of 1.5 times. Their method uses a custom advanced algorithm to cull shadow casters and render only those that contribute to the current main viewpoint.

Another issue of shadow maps is self-shadowing, or surface acne. This is also a result of aliasing, since the continuous scene geometry and its depth data is sampled in a discrete manner into an image when rendering the shadow map. If the shadow map texel does not correlate one-to-one with the final view samples, which happens very often and is highly likely, the shadow map samples will cover a non-zero area on the geometry surface in the final view of the scene, which is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:shadow_mapping_acne_explanation}.
\begin{figure}[hp]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.7\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./graf/shadow_mapping_acne.pdf}
        \caption{Depth samples being compared with depth values over an area of the actual mesh lead to aliasing and shadow acne.}
        \label{fig:shadow_mapping_acne_explanation_3d}
    \end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.7\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./graf/shadow_mapping_acne_side.pdf}
        \caption{The aliasing issue present in shadow maps illustrated in two dimensions from the side.}
        \label{fig:shadow_mapping_acne_explanation_side}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{The cause of shadow acne. Light source \(l\) renders the shadow map onto its projection plane \(p\), having some finite resolution. The sampled depth value \(z\) is stored in a texel. This creates a virtual surface orthogonal to the light direction on top of the actual geometry surface \(s\). When rendering the scene, depth values in the area \(a_1\) will have a lower depth value stored in the shadow map texel than their actual depth, causing them to be in light. Samples in the \(a_2\) area will have greater depth, causing them to be evaluated as being in shadow.}
    \label{fig:shadow_mapping_acne_explanation}
\end{figure}
This can cause the surface to erroneously shadow itself, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:shadow_mapping_acne}. This issue gets more pronounced the higher the angle between the light source view ray and the surface normal. It can be resolved by adding a depth bias when rendering the shadow map, which will ensure the samples are below the actual surface. In modern rendering APIs the depth bias can be configured for a pipeline and applied automatically when rendering. Especially useful is the combination of a constant depth bias and a slope-scaled depth bias. The second bias helps eliminate the problem when surfaces appear more edge-on in the light view by scaling the depth bias with the angle between the light direction and surface. Too high depth bias can cause peter-panning, a situation shown in Fig. \ref{fig:shadow_mapping_panning} where a shadow caster gets detached from its shadow. Because of this, depth bias values often need to be hand-tuned on a per-scene basis. Other approaches have also been proposed, such as using only the back faces of objects to render the shadow map \cite{bib:rep:wang_second_depth_mapping} or utilizing depth peeling to store average depths between the back and front faces of an object \cite{bib:book:woo_midpoint_depth_map}, but they both still require some bias to avoid shadow-acne in areas such as silhouette edges or concavities.

\end{figure}

The z-buffer of a rendered image can be actually non-linear in its \([0-1]\) range. Perspective projection matrices are sometimes built in such a way that the precision closer to \(1\) is lower than closer to \(0\). This is purposefully done to gain more precision closer to the viewer, where it is more needed when performing hidden-surface removal than far away, where objects will become very small due to perspective foreshortening. This can be an issue with shadow mapping, since objects close to the light source are not necessarily close to the viewer. In fact the opposite can often be true. As shown by Stefan Brabec \cite{bib:article:brabec_linear_depth}, the z-buffer for the use in shadow mapping can be linearized using a linear transformation dependent on the projection matrix used. The following perspective projection matrix present in the DX Math library can be linearized with equation \ref{eq:projection_linearization}.

\begin{gather}
	\label{eq:projection_perspective}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		W & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		0 & H & 0 & 0\\
		0 & 0 & \frac{f}{f-n} & \frac{-fn}{f-n}\\
		0 & 0 & 1 & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
		x\\
		y\\
		z\\
		w
	\end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
		Wx\\
		Hy\\
		\frac{zf}{f-n} - \frac{wfn}{f-n}\\
		z
	\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow 
    \begin{pmatrix}
		Wx\\
		Hy\\
		\frac{zf}{f-n} - \frac{fn}{f-n}\\
		z
	\end{pmatrix}
    \quad \text{for} \quad w = 1\\[10pt]
    \begin{pmatrix}
		Wx\\
		Hy\\
		\frac{zf}{f-n} - \frac{fn}{f-n}\\
		z
	\end{pmatrix} / z =
    \begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{Wx}{z}\\
		\frac{Hy}{z}\\
		\frac{f}{f-n} - \frac{fn}{z(f-n)}\\
		1
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{gather}

After the perspective division the final form of the z-value equation is obtained. Below, in Fig. \ref{plot:perspective_z}, the z-values are plotted for exemplary near and far clipping planes equal \(n=2\), \(f=15\).

\begin{figure}[h]

    ]
    \addplot [domain=2.0:17.0] {(15/13)-(30/(13*x))};
    \end{axis} 
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The z-values after a perspective projection become non-linear.}
    \label{plot:perspective_z}
\end{figure}

The values can be linearized back again simply by multiplying the clip-space z-value by \(\frac{z}{f}\), which gives the following equation.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:projection_linearization}
	\left(\frac{f}{f-n} - \frac{fn}{z(f-n)}\right) * \frac{z}{f} = \frac{z-n}{f-n}
\end{align}

In the application z-buffer linearization was not implemented, as after investigation it turned out that an orthographic projection, which is used for the directional light, does not introduce nonlinearity to the z-buffer range. This can be seen by inspecting how the matrix will affect the \(w\) component. The orthographic projection matrix as implemented in the DX Math library is presented below.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:projection_ortho}
	\mathbf{M_{o}} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		W & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		0 & H & 0 & 0\\
		0 & 0 & \frac{1}{f-n} & \frac{-n}{f-n}\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

This matrix does not modify the \(w\) component and the \(z\) values will remain linear. In fact the formula for depth values after using this matrix is exactly the same as the perspective one after linearization.

\subsection{Fitting shadow maps}
An attempt to implement LiSPSM was made, but was not successful due to poor coverage of the implementation details both in the original paper and on the internet.

Only a part of the algorithm was implemented, basically providing simplified fitting of the shadow map view. The shadow map camera has certain extents set up by hand for each scene, such that the whole scene fits within view. Since the entire scene is not necessarily viewed at once by the observer, only the part that is within the observer view frustum can be rendered to the shadow map. Therefore, the shadow map post-projection space can be adjusted to include the area viewed by the observer.

This can be achieved by building a fitting transformation matrix \(\mathbf{F}\) that includes translation and scaling, that is applied after the light view and projection matrices, resulting in \(\mathbf{F}\mathbf{P}_L\mathbf{V}_L\). To obtain \(\mathbf{F}\), first the observer view frustum extents need to be found in world space, which can be obtained by applying the inverse of observer view and projection matrices to an NDC cuboid. This can be a cube with ranges \([-1:1]\) in \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) in APIs like OpenGL, or a cuboid with ranges \([-1:1]\) in \(x\) and \(y\), and \([0:1]\) in \(z\) in DirectX. Once the vertices of this cuboid are moved into world space, they can be multiplied by the view and projection matrices of the light source, \(\mathbf{P}_L\mathbf{V}_L\), and their components divided by \(w\) to bring them into the post-projection space of the light source. Once there, a bounding box can be found enclosing these points. To not move the contents of the shadow map beyond the original extent specified for the light source, the components of the vertices of this bounding box can be clamped to the NDC range. The whole process is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:shadow_map_fitting}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{./graf/shadow_map_focusing.pdf}
	\caption{The steps involved in fitting the shadow map. The NDC cuboid in a) is in observer post-projection space, or clip space. It is moved to the state presented in b) using inverse matrices, resulting in a world space representation of the viewing frustum. It is them transformed into c), the light view clipping space. Finally, a clamped bounding box is found, shown in d).}
	\label{fig:shadow_map_fitting}
\end{figure}
Finally, the minimum and maximum \(x\) and \(y\) values of these bounding vertices can be found and used in the following fitting matrix.
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{F} &= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		s_x & 0 & 0 & o_x\\
		0 & s_y & 0 & o_y\\
		0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}, \text{where}\\[10pt]
	s_x &= \frac{2}{x_{max} - x_{min}} \quad\text{and}\quad o_x = \frac{-s_x(x_{max} + x_{min})}{2}
\end{align}
The calculation of \(s_y\) and \(o_y\) is analogous.

As was implemented, the fitting focuses on an approximate convex body of \(\mathbf{L}\cap \mathbf{V}\), where \(\mathbf{L}\) stands for the light view frustum and \(\mathbf{V}\) for the viewer frustum. The shadow map is then fitted only in the clip space \(x\) and \(y\) dimensions, ignoring depth \(z\). A more robust solution would be to find the convex hull of \(\mathbf{L}\cap \mathbf{V}\cap \mathbf{S}\), with \(\mathbf{S}\) meaning the scene bounding box. Then the shadow map would only focus on areas within the viewer frustum where there exists geometry to render. The near plane of the light frustum can then be set to the upper scene extent and the far plane to the farthest viewer frustum point. The shadow map would then require no hand adjustments to its frustum and would adapt to different scenes and viewer orientations.
